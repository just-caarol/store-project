## General info

This app was created with JavaScript - React.js, Vite.js, React Router DOM, JSON Server and CSS3 to put the acquired knowledge into practice and consolidate the use of these technologies and tools.

### About the app

The application consists of four main pages that can be accessed via the navigation bar at the top of the page. Clicking on a specific link allows a user to navigate to: Home page (by clicking "Grocery Stand"), Products page (by clicking "Products"), Farmers page (by clicking "Farmers") and Cart page (by clicking shopping bag icon or "View Basket").

The application is also adapted to be opened on electronic devices such as tablets or mobile phones.

#### Products page

At the top of this page there are filters that allow a user to filter products by category, e.g. dairy products, vegetables. There is also a search button that allows a user to search for a specific product by its name.

On Products page a user can also add a particular product to the basket by pressing the "Add to Basket" button.

Moreover, by clicking on the product picture, a user goes to the page with details of the given product. On that page a user can add a review of the product by clicking "Add a Review" button.

#### Farmers page

This page contains a list of farmers who supply the products featured on the site.
By clicking the "View" button, a user is navigated to a page with detailed information about a specific farmer. That page contains also a list of products from this particular farmer.

#### Cart page

In this app there are two views of shopping cart:

1. a mini cart and
2. a full-size shopping cart page

##### Mini cart

By clicking on the shopping bag icon, a user has access to a mini shopping cart, which contains information such as: product thumbnail, product price, quantity of products, sum prices of all products.
Within this view a user can make changes on the go like control the number of products in the cart (remove or add products by clicking the plus or minus buttons), remove a given product from the cart or empty the entire cart.
By clicking the "View Basket" link, a user is navigated to a full-size shopping cart page.

##### Full-size shopping cart page

This page contains information about products such as: product thumbnail, product price, price of several pieces of a given product, quantity of products, sum prices of all products.
A user can control the number of products in the cart by removing or adding products (by clicking the plus or minus buttons), removing a given product from the cart or emptying the entire cart.
